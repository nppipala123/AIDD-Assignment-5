Reflection 
AI accelerated this assignment by surfacing a clean checklist from the rubric and scaffolding accessible inline validation quickly. It saved time on boilerplate (error handling, aria attributes, CSS utility classes) and provided professional copy suggestions that I refined to better match my voice. Where AI errored, it occasionally introduced odd special characters (for example, non-printable separators) and generic placeholders; I reviewed changes and corrected these to ensure clean typography and working links. I also verified that every input had an associated label, images had meaningful alt text, and navigation remained consistent across pages. The balance was to let AI handle repetitive structure while I curated content, ensured accuracy, and aligned the design with my goals. I validated layout responsiveness, tested the form, and standardized footers. Overall, AI support improved velocity without replacing judgment; I retained ownership over quality, accessibility, and professionalism throughout.
